## This program gives you a fish based on your current latitude.

## None

## I wanted to create another program at first, tracking top Anime via location however I could not find an API that gave a top anime based on location, so I changed the task to giving fish based on your current location/latitude, but because the API for fish gave a paragraph, I tried processing that paragraph with natural language processing using NLTK, but it failed to extract information, so I ended up giving a fish name based on your latitude.
